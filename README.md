# Push API Notification POC 🚀

Hello there! 🎉

Welcome to my Push API Notification POC. This repository serves as a proof-of-concept (POC) to showcase the implementation of push notifications in a web platform using the Push API. The goal is to demonstrate the immense power of push notifications for providing real-time updates and interaction with users! 📬💡

What will you discover in this repository? 🧐

1. **Practical examples**: This isn't just about theory, but hands-on, real-world examples to help you grasp the concept better. 💼
2. **Easy to understand code**: I've ensured to keep the code simple and comprehensible, making it beginner-friendly! 👌💻
3. **Comprehensive documentation**: I believe that understanding is the first step to successful implementation. Hence, I've prioritized clear and extensive documentation. 📘🔦

So, buckle up and prepare to delve into the exciting world of push notifications. It's going to be a fun ride! 🎢💥


Step 1: Get User Permission
Before you can send notifications to users, you need to get their permission. This is generally done using the Notification.requestPermission() method.

Step 2: Register a Service Worker
A service worker is a script that runs in the web browser and manages caching for an application. This script runs separately from the main browser thread, intercepting network requests, caching or retrieving resources, and delivering push messages.

Step 3: Subscribe the User
After registering your service worker, you need to subscribe the user to your push service. The subscription will include all information the push service needs to send a push message to the user.

Step 4: Send a Push Message
You can send a push message from your server to the user's device via the push service. This involves constructing the correct HTTP request, with the right headers and body content, and making a POST request to the push service.

Step 5: Receive and Display the Notification
Once the service worker receives a push message, it needs to display the message to the user. It can do this even if the application isn't currently active.

For a detailed understanding and implementation of each step, I recommend referring to the Service Worker API and Push API documentation on MDN (Mozilla Developer Network). The APIs involved are complex and have various parameters to consider, so a thorough understanding of the documentation is essential.
